# AGENTS.md

Practices for changing this repository. The cycle checklist for working on LBW
itself is also in `skills/agent-lbw/SKILL.md`.

## Layout

- Package code lives in `src/agent_lbw/`.
- Tests live in `tests/test_<area>.py`. Put a test next to the behavior it
  covers. Do not append a new feature's tests onto an unrelated file.
- Web UI is `src/agent_lbw/templates/index.html`, `static/`, and `web_ui.py`.
- The cycle is `runtime/improve.py`, `runtime/roles.py`, `runtime/review.py`, and `agent/loop.py`.
- Bundled skills ship in `src/agent_lbw/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
- Repo skills live at `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
- Prove a new behavior at a public seam: the `lbw` CLI, an `/api/...` route,
  or the rendered page. Do not add a helper, route, or control that nothing calls.

## Python

- Python 3.12+. Start modules that use annotations with
  `from __future__ import annotations`.
- Line length is 100. Before finishing, run `uv run ruff format src tests`
  then `uv run ruff check src tests`. Ruff selects `E`, `F`, `I`, `UP`, and `B`.
- Use `pathlib.Path` for filesystem paths.
- Name caught exceptions `exc`. Tool and HTTP handlers keep failures in-band:
  tools return `ToolResult(False, message)`, and HTTP errors are
  `{"error": "..."}` with a 4xx status. Do not let a tool exception escape the
  tool runner.
- Prefer a public function over importing another module's `_private` helper.
- Keep imports at the top of the file, in the order ruff applies. A function
  may import a heavy or circular dependency locally when the top-level import
  would cycle.

## Web UI

- The organization page stays `templates/index.html` until a section is moved.
  `docs/frontend-react.md` is the plan for a React client. Do not start that
  move inside an unrelated change.
- JavaScript in `index.html` uses double quotes and `function` declarations for
  named behavior. Iterate with `for...of`.
- Rules, Skills, Schedules, and Roles are rail sections beside Proposals,
  Changes, and Releases. Schedules save documents. A project run is not a
  schedule. The main pane shows the selected section. Builder and QA stay on.
  An organization admin can enforce a role on every project.
- UI layout is the bundled `ui` skill. Visual style is the bundled `style`
  skill. New workspaces enable both with `tdd`.
  After a UI edit, exercise the control in a browser: open it, use it, and
  close it. A template diff is not done. `review_ui` must show the control
  without overlap, unreadable controls, dead buttons, or 404s.
## CSS

- Extract inline styles from templates into `static/layout.css`.
- Do not add inline `style=` attributes to HTML elements in templates.
- Define CSS classes in `layout.css` and apply them to HTML elements.
- Visual style is the bundled `style` skill. When an engineer asks to change
  how the site is styled, update that skill in the same change, then make
  `themes.css` and `layout.css` match it.
- After CSS changes, run `review_ui` to verify the page renders correctly.

## Skills and the cycle

- Agent process belongs in a skill, not in `SYSTEM_PROMPT` or the agent loop.
- If you add a bundled skill, keep `package-data` including `skills/*/SKILL.md`.
- A cycle is finished only when the stated goal is wired through. A later cycle
  is not a substitute for missing data or UI.
- After behavior changes, run `uv run pytest -q`. After Python edits, format
  with ruff, then lint.

## Directory database

Shared rows live in `runtime/store/`. Each file owns one concern: `schema` creates
the tables, `crypto` seals secrets, `install` is the local account, `teams`,
`duties`, and `projects` are access, `tasks` stores a request, `schedules`
indexes when one should run, and `recording` is what the task queue and the
file scheduler call.

- Every shared row carries a tenant id. A tenant is `personal` or `organization`.
  A personal tenant has its owner and no teams. Promote it before adding a team.
  Promotion keeps the tenant id, so projects and tasks stay put.
- A person is an identity, separate from a membership. Rank is `owner`, `admin`,
  or `member`, once on the tenant and once on a team. The first password is
  the owner's, created on the setup page when no password exists. Later sign-in
  uses that email and password. The password is hashed. The session cookie is
  random and only its hash is stored. Sign-in proves an existing person and
  opens that session. A later SSO or SAML login, such as Entra or Auth0,
  matches the same person by email and opens the same session. An organization has members and admins.
  Teams belong to that organization and have members and admins. An empty team can be removed. A person can create another organization from the sign-in page. A crossing guard is an LBW engineer, marked on the person, and is not an organization admin. The engineer dashboard is its own service, `crossing`, in `services/crossing`. It shares `libs/lbw_shared` with the organization site. Compose publishes both through one port. A host whose first label is `crossing` or `crossing-` reaches that service. Locally the organization site is `https://www-local.lookbothways.dev` and the dashboard is `https://crossing-local.lookbothways.dev`. Nginx terminates the local certificate and sends each host to its service. On `127.0.0.1` the path `/crossingguard` is sent to the dashboard. It lists every organization. A menu there adds another LBW engineer. The page can unlock a person and store SSO settings. It does not remove a team, and it does not show a goal, a diff, or a pull request. A job is listed there only when LBW itself failed. Each person
  has a name and an email. Duties are additive
  grants, `billing`, `security`, or `rules`, on a tenant or a team. An owner
  already holds every duty, so do not write a duty row for an owner. A new duty
  is a new value, not a new kind of person.
- An organization owner or admin can use every project in the tenant. Everyone
  else needs a `use` or `manage` grant on their team or on themselves. `manage`
  includes `use`.
- Seal task goals and the GitHub App private key with `runtime/store/crypto.py`
  and the tenant key. The master key stays in `.lbw/master.key`. It does not go
  in the database, a prompt, or a commit. Do not add a second cipher. The
  `github_apps` row stores the app id, the sealed private key, the sealed
  client secret, and the chosen installation. Do not store an installation
  token or a user access token. A connected app can add a
  repository it can see to the organization, a person, or a team. The checkout
  is the workspace. A person connects GitHub from the GitHub tab on their
  personal page once the organization has a GitHub App. Personal rules are
  listed by name. The plus button opens a dialog to add one, and a listed rule
  can be viewed as markdown, edited, or deleted. LBW
  reads their login from GitHub and stores it on `identities.github_login`.
  The client secret is sealed with the tenant key and is not returned. The
  user token is used once to read the login and is not stored. Sync copies that
  account's organization role, team membership, and repository access onto the
  existing grants. It does not create people.
- Do not store model context, prompts, tool traces, or logs in the database.
  Those stay in the run directory. A task row is the request and its outcome:
  tenant, project, requester, status, branch, pull request, `run_ref`,
  `goal_ciphertext`, and `result_ciphertext`. The result seals the plan, the
  steps, the outcome, and the final diff so history can show the file changes
  after the checkout is gone. Logs are not part of it.
- A schedule row is an index. The instruction stays in the schedule file.
  `change` indexes a file schedule. `scan` indexes a scan. Do not copy the
  instruction into the database.
- A rule's text lives in its own KiwiFS space: one for the tenant, one for a
  team, one for a project, and one for a person. The `rules` table indexes it.
  `rule_requirements` says which organization rules a project must follow. Do
  not store the rule body in the database. Derive the space from the scope id.
  Do not take a space name from the client. The `rules` duty lets a member edit
  rules for that tenant or team. Project rules follow `manage`.
- A cloned skill repository is indexed in `skill_repos`. The files and the git
  commit stay in KiwiFS. The space is `sk-org-<id>`, `sk-org-<id>-team-<id>`,
  or `sk-org-<id>-team-<id>-proj-<id>`. Derive it from those ids. Do not put an
  organization, team, or project name in the space. A project reads the
  organization space, a team space only when that team can use the project,
  and its own project space.
- The hierarchy is organization, then teams, then projects. An organization
  rule or skill reaches a project only when it is assigned there: an
  organization rule through `rule_requirements`, a team rule through a project
  grant, a skill through `skill_grants` on the organization, a team, or that
  project. Organization settings stores skill repositories for the whole
  organization and resyncs them there. It does not assign a skill to a
  project. A project turns a loaded skill on. A project page shows the skills
  assigned to it. Roles are chosen on the
  project. `role_requirements` is the set an organization owner or admin
  enforces on every project.
- A model is a bring-your-own endpoint on the organization: OpenAI, Anthropic,
  Google, Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio, or another OpenAI-compatible server. An
  agent is a worker LBW can hand a change to: LBW's builder, Claude Code,
  Codex, or Cursor. LBW remains the orchestrator. The API key is sealed with
  the tenant key and is not returned. Turning a model or an agent on in
  organization settings makes it available on every project. A grant on a
  project, a team, or a person, in `model_grants` and `agent_grants`, still
  allows one that is off. Rank does not include a model or an agent. A team
  grant applies on a project that team can use.
  Every agent requires a person to accept the change before the task can
  succeed. An endpoint stores the model names it returned. Refresh replaces
  that list. Ids are `ep_`, `model_`, `agent_`, `mgr_`, and `agr_`.
- Extend these checks when adding access. Do not add a second permission table.

## Git

- Do not commit, stage, or push `.lbw/` or `history.json`. Config, cloned
  skills, run logs, and screenshots stay local.
- Publishing commits the project files, pushes that branch, and then opens the pull request. The pull request is not opened while those files are still uncommitted, or before the push succeeds.
- Do not force-push, skip hooks, or rewrite published history.
- Do not bind-mount this app's `.lbw` over `/workspaces/.lbw`.
- `lbw init` needs a directory that already exists. Do not document
  `docker clone`.
- Do not ship stubs, TODOs, unused form fields, or "this enables X later".
